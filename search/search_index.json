Rome in September welcomes the end of the summer and this means beautiful weather, lovely sightseeing opportunities and glorious dinners out, with only that touch of chillier temperatures that make the city pleasant rather than oppressively hot like in August. Nevertheless, in view of the possible travel restrictions, the conference will be held in the form of a hybrid conference with as many authors and participants as possible attending the conference in Rome in person, and others attending remotely. The technical program will include physical sessions with on-site presentations and virtual (on-line) sessions for remote participants. More details in the next weeks.

[March 5th, 2021]: Submission page is open! [March 2nd, 2021]: Enrico Nardelli and Rob van Kranenburg will be the keynote speakers [February 19th, 2021]: Ten special tracks were selected, see Calls section Scope GoodIT 2021 will focus on the application of IT technologies to social good. Social good is typically defined as an action that provides some sort of benefit to the general public. In this case, Internet connection, education, and healthcare are all good examples of social goods. However, new media innovations and the explosion of online communities have added new meaning to the term. Social good is now about global citizens uniting to unlock the potential of individuals, technology, and collaboration to create positive societal impact.

About SIGCAS and ACM The GoodIT conference is sponsored by ACM SIGCAS , the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computers & Society. Founded in 1947, ACM is the world's first educational and scientific computing society. Today, ACM serves a membership of more than 80,000 computing professionals in more than 100 countries in all areas of industry, academia, and government. SIGCAS is the ACM Special Interest Group that addresses the social and ethical consequences of widespread computer usage. SIGCAS\u2019 main goals are to raise awareness about the impact that technology has on society, and to support and advance the efforts of those who are involved in this important work.. Our members are computer professionals from both industry and academia, as well as ethicists, psychologists, sociologists and others. We welcome students from a variety of disciplines. Our areas of involvement include computer ethics, universal access to computer technology, security, privacy, and reliability. We collaborate with other ACM bodies that are engaged in related work, such as COPE, USACM, SIGITE and SIGCSE. About the ACM Privacy policy: The Association for Computing Machinery (\"ACM\", \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\") is committed to protecting the privacy of its members and other individuals with whom it interacts. More details can be found here: www.acm.org/privacy-policy. About the handling of conflicts of interest In GoodIT we will strive to avoiding circumstances that would lead to a reasonable person believing there might be some biased processes or results. As general guidelines, and based on the indications offered by the \"Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications\" when determining what to do, GoodIT Organizing Committee will: Use common sense Disclose any potential conflicts Consult with others not involved with the current instance A \"conflict of interest\" occurs when a person\u2019s objective judgment is \u2014 or is perceived by a reasonable observer to be \u2014 compromised by an existing relationship, affiliation, or connection to a person whose work they must evaluate. The GoodIT Organizing Committee will make its best to avoid situations where such relationships may alter the review process, in particular focussing on: Notable personal or professional rivalry/animosity (publicly known or not) Personal or family relationships that would reasonably cause others to doubt impartiality. Potential for financial gain or significant recognition, personally or for a close associate or family member About the Anti-Harassment Policy SIGCAS Welcomes and Embraces Everyone. In keeping with the ACM Anti-Harassment Policy SIGCAS advocates the following: The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of the ACM SIGCAS Organization and its sponsored conferences; these require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. The ACM Code of Ethics embraces the \u201cvalues of equality, tolerance, respect for others, and the principles of equal justice\u201d. For these reasons, the ACM SIGCAS Organization and its sponsored conferences are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience. Harassment is unwelcome or hostile behavior, including speech that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes, in an ACM SIGCAS Organization event. Harassment in any form, including but not limited to harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity, will not be tolerated. Harassment includes the use of gratuitous language or sexual imagery in public presentations and displays, degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Conference participants violating these standards may be sanctioned, expelled from the conference or asked not to attend future conferences or conference events, at the discretion of the conference organizers and the SIG executive committee. If you believe you have been harassed or notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you are encouraged to report the incident in confidence to either of the conference chairs. Offensive Material. SIGCAS reserves the right to reject any material that we find offensive or inappropriate, such as politically charged material, and will not refund any expenses incurred.

He is member of the ACM Europe Council and represents his university in the Management Board of CINI (National Interuniversity Consortium in Informatics). Since 2014 he coordinates \"Programma il Futuro\" , a project run by CINI, in accordance with MIUR (Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research), to introduce in Italian schools the basic concepts of Informatics as a scientific discipline. The project is present in 80% of the Italian schools and is followed by 3 million students. He is the director of the national laboratory \"Informatics and School\" of CINI and member of the Steering Committee of the \"Informatics for All\" coalition, advocating the introduction of Informatics as component of fundamental education in all schools in Europe. His current research activity is Informatics Education and interdisciplinary study of Informatics systems and their social impact, within the Link&Think Research Lab and the CINI National laboratory \"Informatics and Society\". Previously he did research in various fields of Informatics, from algorithms to databases, from geographical information systems to man-machine interaction and cooperative information systems. He also carries out dissemination activity towards the general public regarding Informatics education and the role of Informatics in the digital society. Thursday, September 9th, 2021 Educating in socially responsible Informatics: the next frontier. Our contemporary society is in the middle of an extraordinary transformation, pushed by digital innovations. From mobile devices to autonomous decision-making systems, digital technologies make up the communication and social infrastructure and fill every parcel of space and time, affecting our lives both professionally and personally. For the first time in the history of humanity, cognitive functions are carried out by machines. But their activity is completely detached from the human nature, whose comprehension is beyond their capabilities. It is therefore the duty of their creators, even more than before, to ensure their actions respect human rights and values of a democratic society, much in the same way we require that any industrial artefact respects safety regulations. In this context, a reflection on a possible revision of the way we prepare informatics students for their professional life is highly desirable. Our students should be educated in a more multi-disciplinary way and, beyond knowing about algorithms and automata, networks and concurrency, should develop an appreciation for human and social viewpoints regarding digital systems. Rob van Kranenburg Short Bio: Rob van Kranenburg is the Founder of Council_IoT and #iotday He wrote The Internet of Things. A critique of ambient technology and the all-seeing network of RFID (Network Notebooks 02, Institute of Network Cultures). Together with Christian Nold he published Situated Technologies Pamphlets 8: The Internet of People for a Post-Oil World . Rob is co-editor of Enabling Things to Talk: Designing IoT solutions with the IoT Architectural Reference Model (Springer Open Access). He works as Ecosystem Manager for the EU project Next Generation Internet . Friday, September 10th, 2021 A positive vision of connectivity for society About two decades I was very na\u00efve. I used to think that a full imaginary of technology was founded on empirical knowledge. I taught narrative principles and professed a firm belief in the emancipatory drive of non-reciprocity, as seen in the internet protocol and the web. I had a rethink. When will our old book paradigm institutions come to understand that new digital tech is a full frontal attack and not just another iteration in democratic self-emancipation? Look at all the raised voices of citizens and small initiatives, protesting the skewed power structure consolidating its power since the Industrial Revolution. I founded the #IoT Council in 2009 and the #Iotday in 2010. I imagined a twenty-year plus plan, yet in fact, it took only a decade for the tooling enabled by speed, flow, and success indicator changing generic nature of the Internet to fuel an internet of things. When the Internet of Things was coined, every technological artifact, program and vision, got caught up by feelings of general distrust in both Big Tech and Big Government. People felt powerless, having no choice but to pass between Scylla (billionaires harvesting data and creating new addiction-prone applications) and Charybdis (a hollowed-out state going obsessive-compulsive with behavioral control). Everything was supposedly designed to be \u2018efficient\u2019 or \u2018optimizing\u2019 or creating \u2018transparency\u2019. Either Scylla or Charybdis. A decade ago the correct criticism of thinkers like Adam Greenfield and the Transition Town Movement found severe faults with the smart city projects. The smart cities are now showing failure \u2014 see Sidewalk Labs. But a viable alternative beyond \u2018disconnecting\u2019 is not given. Escape is possible only for affluent individuals and gated communities. I see a plethora of (low fee and fee-less) components from crypto (think of Cardano, IoTa building real use cases). On identity, I see Self-Sovereign Identity schemes on the rise, many local forms of organizing. Think of the massive success of Arduino, Libelium. Many civil society organizations are facilitating edge solutions that bring analytics and purpose close to local data gathering. I see innovative new ways of funding infrastructure like Invested Public Network. Open platforms and processes can be designed to allow citizens, businesses, and organizations. Citizens can co-invest directly into projects that upgrade local public infrastructure, that adapt their home place to climate shifts, that bridge equity gaps. Crowdfunding can overcome limited borrowing capacity, and shared currency commitments can shape and sustain a healthy community. I recently published an inter-disciplinary urban renewal vision, for connectivity as a win win society. We imagined forward-thinking social entrepreneurship and happy communities of people describing \u2018cold spots\u2019 and not only hot zones or nothing. I see 6G governance as including Cyber-physical Systems. My talk will bring a positive version of Stafford Beer's Cybersyn, since today we also have the tools to make connectivity truly decentralized and much more distributed. van Kranenburg R. et al.
